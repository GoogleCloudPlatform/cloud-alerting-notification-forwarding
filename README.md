# Sample Code for the Cloud Monitoring Alerting Notification Delivery Integration Guide

**This is not an officially supported Google product.**

This repository provides examples of how a Google Cloud user can forward **[alerting notifications](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/alerts#how_does_alerting_work)** to third-party integrations not officially supported as **[notification channels](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/support/notification-options)**. The provided example forwards alerting notifications to  Google chat rooms via Cloud Pub/Sub notification channels. The example accomplishes this through the use of a Flask server running on Cloud Run which receives alerting notifications from Cloud Pub/Sub notification channels, parses them into Google chat messages, and then delivers the messages to Google chat rooms via HTTP requests.

The sample code in this repository is referenced in this **[Cloud Community Blog Post](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/operations/write-and-deploy-cloud-monitoring-alert-notifications-to-third-party-services)**.

## Setup

1. Create a [new Google Cloud Platform project from the Cloud
   Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/project) or use an existing empty project.

2. Be sure to [enable billing](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/modify-project) in your new GCP project.

3. Click the "Open in Cloud Shell" button below to clone and open this repository on Cloud Shell.

[![Open in Cloud Shell](https://gstatic.com/cloudssh/images/open-btn.svg)](https://ssh.cloud.google.com/cloudshell/editor?cloudshell_git_repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fgooglecloudplatform%2Fcloud-alerting-notification-forwarding)

## Automatic deployment

To deploy the notification channel integration sample for the first time automatically, we've provided a script `deploy.py` that will handle a majority of the required actions for deployment. Complete the following steps before running the script.

1. Ensure Python 3.5 or higher is installed in Cloud Shell. Run the following command to check. More information about how to set up a Python development environment can be found at [here](https://cloud.google.com/python/docs/setup).
  ```
  python3 --version
  ```

2. In `~/notification_integration/main.py` edit the `config_map` dictionary replacing the webhook_url with your own Google Chat webhook url. 
```
config_map = {
    'tf-topic-cpu': {
        'service_name': 'google_chat',
        'msg_format': 'card',
        'webhook_url': '<YOUR_GOOGLE_CHAT_ROOM_WEBHOOK_URL>'},
    'tf-topic-disk': {
        'service_name': 'google_chat',
        'msg_format': 'card',
        'webhook_url': '<YOUR_GOOGLE_CHAT_ROOM_WEBHOOK_URL>'}
}
```

3. Run the script with the following command:
  ```
  python3 deploy.py -p <PROJECT_ID>
  ```

## Manual Deployment

To deploy the notification channel integration sample manually, complete the following steps. Make sure to first complete the integration specific deployment steps.

1. Set the Cloud Platform Project in Cloud Shell. Replace `<PROJECT_ID>` with your Cloud Platform project id:
```
gcloud config set project <PROJECT_ID>
```

2. Enable the Cloud Build Service:

```
gcloud services enable cloudbuild.googleapis.com
```

3. Enable the Cloud Resource Manager Service:

```
gcloud services enable cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com
```

4. Enable the Cloud Service Usage Service:

```
gcloud services enable serviceusage.googleapis.com
```

5. Grant the required permissions to your Cloud Build service account:

```
CLOUDBUILD_SA="$(gcloud projects describe $PROJECT_ID --format 'value(projectNumber)')@cloudbuild.gserviceaccount.com"

gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT_ID --member serviceAccount:$CLOUDBUILD_SA --role roles/iam.securityAdmin

gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT_ID --member serviceAccount:$CLOUDBUILD_SA --role roles/run.admin

gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT_ID --member serviceAccount:$CLOUDBUILD_SA --role roles/editor
```

6. Create Cloud Storage bucket to store Terraform states remotely:

```
PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config get-value project)

gsutil mb gs://${PROJECT_ID}-tfstate
```

7. (Optional) You may enable Object Versioning to keep the history of your deployments:

```
gsutil versioning set on gs://${PROJECT_ID}-tfstate
```

8. Update the configuration with your own Google chat room webhook Urls.

If you want to use the in-memory configuration server, update the `config_map` variables with your own Google chat room webhook urls in `~/notification_integration/main.py`:
```
config_map = {
    'tf-topic-cpu': {
        'service_name': 'google_chat',
        'msg_format': 'card',
        'webhook_url': '<YOUR_GOOGLE_CHAT_ROOM_WEBHOOK_URL>'},
    'tf-topic-disk': {
        'service_name': 'google_chat',
        'msg_format': 'card',
        'webhook_url': '<YOUR_GOOGLE_CHAT_ROOM_WEBHOOK_URL>'}
}
```

If you'd like to not expose your webhook urls in the case of a public repo, create a gcs bucket to store the configuration in a json file. Complete the following steps:

a) Create the GCS bucket
```
gsutil mb gs://gcs_config_bucket_{PROJECT_ID}
```

b) Upload a json file containing the configuration data named `config_params.json` to the newly created gcs bucket

You can use ~/notification_integration/config_params.json as a template and update the webhook urls to yours.

c) Grant the read permissions (Storage Legacy Bucket Reader and
Storage Legacy Object Reader) to the default Cloud Run service account <PROJECT_NUMBER>-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com

8. Trigger a build and deploy to Cloud Run:

If you use the in-memory config server, run (replace `<BRANCH>` with the current environment branch)

```
gcloud builds submit . --config cloudbuild.yaml --substitutions BRANCH_NAME=<BRANCH>,_CONFIG_SERVER_TYPE=in-memory
```

If you use the GCS based config server, run
```
gcloud builds submit . --config cloudbuild.yaml --substitutions BRANCH_NAME=<BRANCH>,_CONFIG_SERVER_TYPE=gcs
```

Note that this step uses Terraform to automatically create necessary resources in the Google Cloud Platform project. For more info on what resources are created and managed, refer to the Terraform section below.

9. Create a VM instance to trigger alert policies:

```
gcloud services enable compute.googleapis.com
gcloud compute instances create {vm_name} --zone={zone}
```

10. Congratulations! Your service should be now successfully deployed to Cloud Run and alerts will be forwarded to your provided Google Chat room(s) in several minutes.

### Redeploy

If you've already deployed once manually and want to build and redeploy a new version, do the following:

1.  Checkout the desired GitHub environment branch.

2.  Re-run Step 8.

## Continuous Deployment

Refer to this solutions guide for instructions on how to setup continuous deployment: TBD

### Unit Tests

To run unit tests :

```
bash ./scripts/run_tests.sh
```

### Linting

To be updated.

## Terraform

Terraform is a HashiCorp open source tool that enables you to predictably create, change, and improve your cloud infrastructure by using code. In this project, Terraform is used to automatically create and manage necessary resources in Google Cloud Platform.

### Resources provisioned with Terraform

Terraform will create the following resources in your cloud project:
* A Cloud Run service called `cloud-run-pubsub-service` to deploy the Flask application
* Two Pub/Sub topics called `tf-topic-cpu` and `tf-topic-disk`
* Two Pub/Sub push subscriptions: one is called `alert-push-subscription-cpu` that subscribes the topic `tf-topic-cpu` and the other is called `alert-push-subscription-disk` that subscribes the topic `tf-topic-disk`; both set the push endpoint to `cloud-run-pubsub-service`
* A service account with ID `cloud-run-pubsub-invoker` to represent the Pub/Sub subscription identity
* Two Cloud Pub/Sub notification channels
* Two Cloud Alerting policies: one is based on the GCE instance CPU usage_time metric and the other is based on the GCE instance Disk read_bytes_count metric.

In addition, Terraform configures the following authentication policies:
* Enabling Pub/Sub to create authentication tokens in your gcloud project
* Giving the `cloud-run-pubsub-invoker` service account permission to invoke `cloud-run-pubsub-service`
* Adding authentication for `alert-push-subscription` using the `cloud-run-pubsub-invoker` service account

These configurations will be applied automatically on source code changes after connecting Cloud Build with GitHub and when deploying manually.

### Run Terraform Manually

Deployment with Terraform will be automated through source code changes in GitHub. To manually see and apply the changes Terraform makes to your Cloud project resources, do the following:

Navigate to the environment folder and run the following:

Initialize a working directory containing Terraform configuration files:
```
terraform init -backend-config "bucket=$PROJECT_ID-tfstate"
```
Refresh the current Terraform state:
```
terraform refresh -var="project=$PROJECT_ID"
```

To see what changes will be made without applying them yet:
```
terraform plan -var="project=$PROJECT_ID"
``` 

Apply configuration changes:
```
terraform apply -var="project=$PROJECT_ID"
```
When prompted, type `yes` to confirm changes. Once finished, information about the created resources should appear in the output.
